#  Write a python program for the following:
#   – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
#    Sample input: •python 
# •  Sample output: •ntyp 


# str=input("Enter the input string:")

# # Deleting at least 2 characters from the string 

# if len(str)>=2:
#     str=str[:-2]

# else:
#     str=str[:-1]

# #reversing the string 

# print(str[::-1])



# # Take Two numbers from user and perform at least 4 Arithmetic operations on them 

a=int(input("Enter the Number 1:"))
b=int(input("Enter the Number 2:"))
print(a+b) # addition
print(a-b) #subtraction
print(a*b) #Multiplication
print(a/b) #division
